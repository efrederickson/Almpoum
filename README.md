Almpoum
=====================

----------

An incredible screen shot replacement utility. 

> **Features:**
> 
> - Saving screenshots to a custom album.
> - Be prompted with a pop-up asking what you'd like to happen, save, copy to the clipboard, etc.
> - Customizing the screen flash, sound, and much more.
> - Disabling the upload of screenshots to your Photo Stream.
> - And much more!

The tweak can be downloaded *[here][3]*.


Please note there is an extensive use of `pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wdeprecated-declarations"` which will likely result in a lot more work later (when they remove the deprecated methods).
